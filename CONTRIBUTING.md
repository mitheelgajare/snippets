# Contributing to snippets:

We are glad to know that you are eager to contribute to snippets. Every commit is highly appreciated, be it a grammatical error fix or a new feature.

Before contributing please read our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](https://github.com/mitheelgajare/snippets/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Raising issues:

Have you find a bug in our code? Do you have a new feature suggestion? Do you want to ask a question? Well, the best place to communicate with us is in the **issues** tab.
While raising an issue, use an issue template  *preferably*. If none of the issue templates fit your exact requirement, you are welcome to open a blank issue. 

**While raising an issue make sure to give as much information as possible. This would minimize further discussion and contributors will be able to focus on resolving the issue**

## Contributing:

Contributing is to be done throught pull requests. Here are some instructions to be adhered to while writing pull requests:

- [ ] Write descriptive pull requests explaining in detail what the changes you have done are.
- [ ] If the pull request fixes an issue, reference that issue. This will automatically close the issue once the pull request is accepted.
- [ ] Before you start working on a major pull request, raise an issue suggesting the feature enhancement that you are making. Otherwise if the pull request is not accepted, all of your hard work will be of no use.
- [ ] Write pull request that add small changes to the repository. For example instead of adding ten features in one pull request, write different pull requests for each feature. This will make it easy for code reviewers.
- [ ] Write all pull requests to the master branch. Do *not* create a new branch.

### All pull requests must have the following format:

#### {prefix}: {message}

The valid prefixes are:

1. fix: On fixing a bug
1. feat: On adding a new feature
1. docs: On changing documentation
